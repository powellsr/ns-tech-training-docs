## Responsibilities
The production or livestream volunteer is responsible for managing video feeds and production of the livestream and for controlling the remote-controlled cameras. They are responsible for ensuring the livestream is a smooth, professional, undistracting, and engaging viewing experience, and is a passable reflection of in-person attendence to the degree this is possible. 

## Physical Controls
The controls which the lighting volunteer is responsible for and through which they will fulfill their role are the following:

- Video switcher
- Video chanel patcher
- Remote camera controls (two remote controlled cameras)
- Two cameras on tripods

The production volunteer should be familiar with the function and usage of each of these. 

### Video switcher
### Video chanel patcher
### Remote camera controls (two remote controlled cameras)
### Two cameras on tripods

## Setup and Teardown


### Setup / Before Service
- Ensure the booth power is on __more on this__. 
- Turn on camera 3 and set to record (and is positioned correctly for the first song). If memory space will not sustain recording the services for the day, delete older video files until there is enough storage
- Turn on camera 4
- Send the welcome slide loop to the livestream feed before the livestream is started

### Teardown / After Service
- Play outro slides from the end of service until the crowd in the church begins to thin out
- Turn off camera 3. __Generally, I delete video files immediately, but this is probably poor general practice. My anal-retentive nature, I guess__
- Turn off camera 4
- The projection volunteer is generally responsible for turning off booth power
