## Typical Order of Service and Responsibilities

- It's best to arrive around the same time as the band in order to prepare the presentation files and check the ordering of the worship lyrics.
- Turn on the main power: Booth Power, GAP Room TVs, Lights Power. Power on the projection computer and open ProPresenter. Turn on Projector power. Pray that the signal locks, so you won't have to go through the whole dance of relocking the video output signals.
- Ensure that all the files and songs are in the playlist for the week. You should receive an email with the scripture references and any slides or videos for the week. Download these and add them to the playlist for the service. For the slides, add a new presentation (File -> New -> presentation; or Cmd+n), ensuring you add the new presentation to the playlist for the service (dropdown menu in the window for creating a new presentation). Copy the dowloaded slides into this new presentation and delete the default empty slide at the beginning of the presentation. 
- Add the scripture references. Click "Bible" on the upper right portion of the ProPresenter widow. Enter the scripture references in the text box to find the verses. The reference should be entered with the full name of the book, then chapter:verse1-verse2. At the bottom of the window, press save to playlist, then select the current playlist. Do this for all the references. 
- After adding the scriptures, ensure that there are no more than 3-4 lines per slide, to avoid interfering with the livestream's video feed. Select the scripture playlist, then go to the "Reflow" view, and press ctrl+Enter to break scripture onto a new slide. You can press delete while at the beginning of a slide to combine slides.
- While the band is practicing, check that the lyrics are in the proper order for the song. For each song, press the button that looks like three squares laid out horizontally at the right end of the banner along the song lyrics. Then, select the "Northstar" arrangement from the dropdown menu to the left. If none exists, create one. In general, you should be able to address any issues with the lyrics by dragging-and-dropping the lyric groupings into the current arrangement or deleting unnecessary groups. 
- TODO: adding backgrounds
- Begin playing the pre-service slides before starting the livestream. 
  - Be sure to look out for obsolete slides (referring to events already past). Remove these as necessary.
  - Check for timers: these look like a '5.0' in the upper left corner of the slide. If this is not present, left click on the slide then select 'Add timer', and set to 5.0 seconds. Note: this does not apply to the 30-second video at the beginning of the slides. Only the last slide should have the "Loop to beginning" box checked. 
- Start the livesream about 10 minutes before service begins: open a safari browser window. Go to ultrastream (start typing, and this should be offered as an autocomplete option, and as a 'favorites' page. The login information should be saved. Press "Live" to begin livestreaming. It's also good practice to press "Rec" to begin recording a backup feed). 
- As service begins,  put up the Northstar logo on the middle screen and select the background (first slide) of the first song. A small block of text will appear with copyright song information. Advancing the slide will replace this with the first lyric slide. You can advance the slides with the arrow keys or click on the appropriate slide. On the right side of the screen, click the button with three parallel horizontal lines to clear the lyrics or text from the screen (which you may want to do during an extended instrumental section). Pressing the 'picture' icon will clear the background. Pressing the tall rectangular button with the 'x' icon will clear everything from the screens.
