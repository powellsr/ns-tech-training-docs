-   [ ] Arrive around the same time as the band (typically two hours before the first service).
-   [ ] Make sure that all Main/Matrix outputs are unmuted!
-   [ ] Main PA, Stereo PA, Near PA, and Subs faders should be at about -5 dB.
-   [ ] Record Future and Stream Mix faders should be at +5 dB, GAP Room should be around 0 dB, and Halls should be around -10 dB.
-   [ ] Referencing the external Sound Level Meter, average should be between 85 - 90 dBA (slow response), with short peaks above that.
-   [ ] Don't forget to record the sermon on a flash drive! Record controls are at the top of the touchscreen, under an icon that looks like a flash drive.
