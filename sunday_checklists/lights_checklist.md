# Lights Sunday Morning Checklist

[Back to Overview](README.md)
[Back to Lights Training](lights.md)

## Before (First) Service

-   [ ] Arrive about 15 minutes before the first service.
-   [ ] Typically, the booth power, lights, and computer will all be on by this point already, but if not, turn them on.
-   [ ] Start up the lighting software. Press 'Continue Show' when the software initializes. Log in as admin (Settings -> General -> User).
-   [ ] Turn panel lighting to 50% then use the lighting software/sliders to set the main auditorium lights to 90-100%.
-   [ ] Turn on the lockout so lights can only be controlled by sliders.
-   [ ] Determine lighting colors for each of the worship songs (to match background slide colors).
-   [ ] Optional: set the stage lighting to 'Preservice'. You may also just set them to the first song color.
-   [ ] Immediately before service: auditorium lights should be at 90-100%. Stage lights should be on, set to preservice or lighting colors for the first song.

## During Service(s)

-   [ ] As welcome video begins, slowly dim the lights in the auditorium and on stage so there's less glare on screens.
-   [ ] First song: dim auditorium (and overflow) lights to ~40%. Turn worship lights on to 90% and to the appropriate color. 'Preach', 'Pre-Service', and all other lights (other than auditorium / overflow lights) should be off.
-   [ ] As first song ends / announcements begin: Fade 'Preach' setting on to 90% and 'Worship' setting off or very low. Bring auditorium / overflow lights to ~70%.
-   [ ] Greeting time: leave auditorium / overflow lights up (at least 70%). Close the garage doors as soon as the coast is clear and you won't be interrupted by pedestrians. You may change to the worship lights and turn 'Preach' lights off whenever.
    -   [ ] If you're really good, as the band is getting ready to / calling people back to worship, fade down the auditorium lights to worship setting (40%) to help get people to stop talking and find their seats already.
-   [ ] Second song: ensure lights are on worship ('Preach' off), and at the right color and power (90% stage (worship) / 40% auditorium).
-   [ ] Third song (if applicable): change to the correct color. Maintain 90/40 brightness.
-   [ ] As the pastor comes up: Fade to 'Preach' lights at 90%. Fade worship off or very low. Fade auditorium lights up to ~65-70% (generally after opening prayer).
-   [ ] Message: maintain 90/40 brightness.
-   [ ] Ending song: Fade 'Worship' setting to 90% and 'Preach' off. Fade auditorium lights to 40%.
    -   [ ] Open garage doors when band gets loud (usually last chorus).
-   [ ] End of closing prayer: fade auditorium lights to 90-100%. You may leave the last worship setting on while the band tears down.

## In-Between Services (if applicable)

-   [ ] Make any changes/updates or discuss anything that went poorly in first service.

## After Service(s)

-   [ ] Set the auditorium lights to 100% (using sliders).
-   [ ] Turn off the lockout.
-   [ ] Use wall panel to set lights to 100%.
-   [ ] Close the lighting software and power off the lighting computer.
-   [ ] Move all the sliders on the lighting console to the bottom position (off, 0%).
-   [ ] When stage work is done, turn off all remaining stage lights using the in-wall panels. (Leave the auditorium lights on if anyone remains in the auditorium.)
-   [ ] Ensure everything (besides the main auditorium lights) is off, the garage door opener is returned to it's hook, and the lockout is off.
