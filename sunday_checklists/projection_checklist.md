# Projection/Slides Sunday Morning Checklist

[Back to Overview](../README.md)
[Back to Projection Training](../projection.md)

## Before (First) Service

-   [ ] Arrive around the same time as the band (typically two hours before the first service).
-   [ ] Turn on the main power: Booth Power, GAP Room TVs, Lights Power, and Projector Power.
-   [ ] Power on the presentation computer and open ProPresenter, if not already running.
-   [ ] Start the service countdown timer.
-   [ ] Ensure that all the files and songs are in the playlist for the week (based on Order of Service sheet).
    -   [ ] Welcome/farewell slides
        -   [ ] Look for obsolete slides (referring to events already past). Remove these as necessary.
        -   [ ] Start playing these on the announcements center screen.
    -   [ ] Announcements slides
        -   [ ] Make sure these match listed announcments on Order of Service sheet (in addition to Howdy Card and Church Center slides).
    -   [ ] Worship songs
        -   [ ] Make sure no slide is over 4 lines long
        -   [ ] If the lyrics are oddly sized or aren't capitalized uniformly, apply our preferred default formatting.
        -   [ ] While the band is practicing, check that the lyrics are in the proper order for the song.
    -   [ ] Sermon notes
    -   [ ] Scripture references
        -   [ ] Make sure no slide is over 4 lines long
    -   [ ] Any videos or extra slides for special events - Baptisms, mission trip share, etc.
-   [ ] After adding both the sermon slides and the song lyrics, make sure the appropriate macro action is added to the first slide of each (on the title slide for sermon slides and the motion background for songs).
-   [ ] Begin playing the pre-service slides before starting the livestream.
    -   [ ] Check for timers: these look like a '5.0' in the upper left corner of the slide (this is narrowly visible). If this is not present, right click on the slide then select 'Add timer', and set to 5.0 seconds. Note: this does not apply to the 30-second video at the beginning of the slides, which should have a 0.0 second timer. Only the last slide should have the "Loop to beginning" box checked.
    -   [ ] Clear any song lyrics or scripture references from the screen
-   [ ] Start livestream 10 MINUTES BEFORE SERVICE STARTS

## During Service(s)

-   [ ] During worship, show the song lyrics as they are sung.
-   [ ] During announcements (after the first song), show the slides relevant to each announcement while they're being discussed.
-   [ ] During the message, show the relevant scriptures and slides as they are read / discussed. When no slides are being shown, the middle screen should have the Northstar logo displayed or the sermon series graphic.
-   [ ] Generally, the offering is taken at the end of the message as the last song begins. Show the "Ways to Give" slide as the offering is being announced, and for ~30 seconds after.
-   [ ] After the end of the last song, play the outro slides and clear everything else off the screens.

## In-Between Services (if applicable)

-   [ ] End previous livestream 10 MINUTES AFTER SERVICE ENDS.
-   [ ] Make any changes/updates or fix anything that went poorly in first service.
-   [ ] Start next livestream 10 MINUTES BEFORE SERVICE STARTS.

## After Service(s)

-   [ ] End livestream 10 MINUTES AFTER SERVICE ENDS.
-   [ ] Shut down ProPresenter, the computer, and all 4 power buttons.
