# Video/Cameras Sunday Morning Checklist

[Back to Overview](README.md)
[Back to Video Training](video.md)

## Before (First) Service

-   [ ] Arrive about 15 minutes before the first service.
-   [ ] Turn on camera 3, set to record, and ensure it is positioned correctly for the first song. If memory space will not sustain recording the services for the day, delete older video files until there is enough storage.
-   [ ] Turn on camera 4.
-   [ ] Send the welcome slide loop to the livestream feed before the livestream is started.

## During Service(s)

-   [ ] Send the welcome video to the livestream feed.
-   [ ] Switch video feeds as appropriate through the worship and message.
    -   [ ] Generally, switching approximately every 20-30 seconds during worship sets is reasonable, showing different parts or views of the band, and including panning shots as desired.
    -   [ ] If there are any videos during announcements, the message, or after the final song (a common time for showing baptism videos), be sure to feed the video input to the livestream.
    -   [ ] Show a clear view of the person delivering announcements (generally camera 3 or 5), and briefly show the announcement slides as they are discussed.
    -   [ ] During the greeting time (if any), it's generally best to show a wide-angle shot from the back of the auditorium (camera 4 is great for this, although camera 5 can work as well).
    -   [ ] During the message, cameras 3 and 5 are best to set up fairly close shots of the speaker. Be sure to watch out for them walking out of frame if they pace. Generally, switch video feeds only a few times over the course of the message, maximum every 5 minutes.
    -   [ ] Put up slides and visual aids briefly, but so that the livestream audience could follow and understand them as necessary.
    -   [ ] During the speaker's closing prayer, it is generally best to use camera 5 zoomed in closely to avoid capturing band members coming onto the stage.
    -   [ ] Display the 'ways to give' slide briefly while the giving time is announced.
    -   [ ] Switch video feeds as described above during the last song.
-   [ ] Play outro slides from the end of service until at least after the livestream ends.

## In-Between Services (if applicable)

-   [ ] Make any changes/updates or discuss anything that went poorly in first service.

## After Service(s)

-   [ ] Play outro slides from the end of service until at least after the livestream ends.
-   [ ] Ensure all cameras are in a standard position (not turned completely the wrong direction or zoomed wildly).
-   [ ] Turn off camera 3. Delete older video files until there is enough space to record the next service. (Menu -> Oldest video -> trash button -> confirm)
-   [ ] Turn off camera 4.
