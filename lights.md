## Responsibilities
The lighting person is responsible for the stage and sanctuary lights, ensuring that the audience can view the goings-on onstage clearly and without distraction. Typcially, the lighting volunteer is also responsible for opening and closing the garage doors leading into the south side of the sanctuary.

## Physical Controls
The controls which the lighting volunteer is responsible for and through which they will fulfill their role are the following:

- Garage door opener, hanging on a hook on the rightmost wall of the main AV booth
- In-wall light panels, on the rightmost wall of the main AV booth
- Lighting console, stationed in front of the lighting computer
- Ligting computer, the rightmost workstation in the main AV booth

The lighting volunteer should be familiar with the function and usage of each of these. 

### Garage door opener
This opener has three buttons which correspond to the three garage doors on the south side of the sanctuary. The buttons, labeled I-III, correspond in order to the doors from closest to stage to furthest from the stage. One push of the button starts moving the corresponding door to the opposite of it's current position (an open door will begin to close, a closed door will begin to open, etc.). If in motion, a button push will stop the garage door. Another push will reverse it's motion from the last direction of travel. The doors are each equiped with blockage sensors approximately 3-4 inches from the ground. If any object crosses the line between the sensors while the door is closing, the door will stop closing  and begin to open. 

Frankly, it's a garage door. It's not that complicated.

### In-wall Panels
There are three relevant panels here, each on the right wall of the main AV booth, just above the surface of the desk. The button lit in blue for each of these is the active setting. Amber / orange backlighting indicates an inactive selection. The panel closest to the front of the sanctuary has three sets of buttons. The first, closes to the front of the sanctuary, controls the sanctuary lights. It has settings for different levels of brightness and an 'off' button. Typically, the lights are on full except during service, when these lights are generally controlled from the console. *Note: this panel has priority over the console, so the lights cannot be made dimmer than whatever they are set to on this panel from the console. This means the 'off' button should be selected before service to relinquish control to the console.* 

The next set of buttons controls the stage lights. It has a few common pre-sets which are also represented on the console / lighting software. These are rarely used.  

The third set of (one) button(s) is a simple on / off switch for the overflow seating lights. Again, these are typically controlled from the console during service. 

The second, middle panel holds a lock-out key cylinder. There should be a keyring with two identical keys plugged into the cylinder. Do not remove these. If they aren't there, begin panicking as best as you know how. There is a small indicator light at the top of the cylinder. If the light is eluminated in blue, this indicates that the lockout is set, meaning the panels in the wall are inactive, and the lights can only be controlled from the console or lighting software.
> Just the front panel or the overflow, too?

If the blue indicator light is not eluminated, the lockout is off, and the lights can be controlled from the wall panel and the software / console. In this case the wall panels generally have priority, but the lighting console may still have some control. For example, if the lockout is off and the wall panel has the sanctuary lights set at 50%, the lighting console / software can be used to change the lights to any power from 50%-100%, but cannot lower the light level below 50%. 
Before service begins, it is the best practice to set the wall panels as appropriate to give the console control and to set the lockout to avoid accidental or wayward button presses from changing the lights unexpectedly. 

The third panel is a dimmer switch that provides control over a set of LED lights set up at the back of the stage. These can be useful for providing a little additional light for volunteers working on stage if the stage lights are off / too dim. These should be off during service. Two notes on this: 1) There is also a control panel on stage in the wings, so people on stage can mess with these, too 2) These lights are LEDs, so they are not capable of dimming. The only relevant buttons, then, are the top ('on') and bottom ('off') buttons. The lights will flicker randomly when turned on or off. This is normal. A dimmer panel was used for this in construction for perfectly good and not at all irrational reasons or merely for convenience. In order to master or even undertsand the Tau of AV, you must embrace the chaos and occasional appearance of irrationality. 

### Lighting Console

The Lighting Console (Mini Wing) consists of 10 sliders, each with an associated play queue button and some other button, which I don't know what they do, in addition to the main power slider and buttons. The main power slider and blackout button are disabled. 

The main queues use in sunday worship are PreService, Worship Looks, Preach 1, FOH (Front Of House, the main sanctuary lights), and Overflow. The FOH and Overflow lights together control the sanctuary lighting. The rest of the sliders correspond to stage lights. For those mentioned above, fading the sliders up from 0% also has the effect of playing the queue, which fade the lights from their previous colors and brightnesses to the selected queue. 

In brief, the usage of the lights during an ordinary service include: managing the sanctuary lights brighness as described in [Typical Order of Service and Responsibilities], using PreService before the start of the service (optional), and switching between Preach and Worship as appropriate. The Worship Looks queue has a list of 8 preset lighting looks for worship. These are the nearly exclusive stage worship lights. The queue can be advanced to the next look by pressing the play button above the Worship looks slider. Pressing multiple times can be used to skip through to the desired queue usually without disturbing the colors due to the 3 second fade time. Note the if the Worship Looks slider is turned, to zero, fading the slider on again will restart the queue at the top, with Blue.

Note that it is preferred to fade off whichever of Preach or Worship is not in use due to differences in the general brighness of the stage in different parts for these two looks, so it is not just the color of the lights that are different. Fading the sliders very low can also be effective, which can allow the lighting volunteer to save the place in the Worship Looks queue if desired. 

The other sliders: Full Stage, Left Stage, Center Stage, and Left Stage can be used to add more brightness to the stage as desired. The Color Spots slider can be used to control the brighness of the colored spot lights at the back of the stage. These give a subtle effect, and should not be used for chaning the brightness on stage. These are rarely used.

## Setup and Teardown
### Setup / Before Service
- Set the main sanctuary lights to 90-100%
- Ensure the main lights power is on. This is located on the main control panel, on the left side of the AV booth at the projection station, beneath the secondary monitor. There is a row of rectangular buttons, eluminated red when off, white when on. Push the 'Lights Power' button to turn them on. 
- If the band is already setting up / practicing and needs lighting, turn on the auxiliary worklights with the dimmer switch panel and / or turn on some lights on the stage with the stage lights panel. Note that the main lights power will need to be on for this to work. (not for the auxiliary work lights)
- Turn on the lights computer. No password is necessary. Start up the lighting software. Press 'Continue Show' when the software initializes. Log in as admin if relevant. (Settings -> General -> User)
- At this point, lighting control though the panel and software is available. It is recommended that either now or at some point before the service, the in-wall light panels are set to off and the lockout is set.
- Determine lighting colors for the worship songs. 
- Optional: set the stage lighting to 'Preservice'. You may also just set them to the first song color.

### Teardown / After Service
- Turn off the lockout.
- Leave some sort of stage lighting on until the band / volunteer workers are done on stage. If you wish to shut down the lighting computer, you may use the in-wall panels to provide stage lighting while doing so. 
- *Set the sanctuary lights to 100% (in most cases)* You will want to do this before shutting down the lighting computer, but it is best practices to do it immediately after service to avoid accidents. 
- Ensure that the lockout is off and the stage and sanctuary lights are set to a reasonable setting using the in-wall panels, then close the lighting software and power off the lighting computer. Move all the sliders on the lighting console to the bottom position (off, 0%).
- When stage work is done, turn off all remaining stage lights using the in-wall panels. Leave the sanctuary lights on if anyone remains in the sanctuary. These are generally turned off while closing up the church. 
- Ensure everything (besides the main sanctuary lights) is off, the garage door opener is returned to it's hook, and the lockout is off.
- You're done! The main lighting power is generally turned off by the projection volunteer at the end of their shift. 

## Typical Order of Service and Responsibilities
- Immediately before service: sanctuary lights should be at 90-100%. Stage lights should be on, set to preservice or lighting colors for the first song. 
- First song: dim sanctuary (and overflow) lights to ~40%. Turn worship lights on to 90% and to the appropriate color. 'Preach', 'Pre-Service', and all other lights (other than sanctuary / overflow lights) should be off. 
- As first song ends / announcements begin: Fade 'Preach' setting on to 90% and 'Worship' setting off or very low. Bring sanctuary / overflow lights to ~70%. 
- Greeting time: leave sanctuary / overflow lights up (at least 70%). Close the garage doors as soon as the coast is clear and you won't be interrupted by pedestrians. You may change to the worship lights and turn 'Preach' lights off whenever. If you're really good, as the band is getting ready to / calling people back to worship, fade down the sanctuary lights to worship setting (40%) to help get people to stop talking and find their seats already. 
- Second song: ensure lights are on worship ('Preach' off), and at the right color and power (90% stage (worship) / 40% sanctuary).
- Third song: change to the correct color. Maintain 90/40 brightness.
- As the preacher comes up: Fade to 'Preach' lights at 90%. Fade worship off or very low. Fade sanctuary lights up to ~65-70% (generally after opening prayer).
- Message: maintain 90/40 brightness.
- Ending song: Fade 'Worship' setting to 90% and 'Preach' off. Fade sanctuary lights to 40%.
- End of closing prayer: fade sanctuary lights to 90-100%. You may leave the last worship setting on while the band tears down. 

> If there is a video, generally leave the sanctuary lights wherever they're set, but fade whatever is on stage lower to avoid washing out the screen. You may need to fade these lower if the sanctuary lights are brighter.
