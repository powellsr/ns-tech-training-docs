## Responsibilities
The live video or livestream volunteer is responsible for managing video feeds and production of the livestream and for controlling the remote-controlled cameras. They are responsible for ensuring the livestream is a smooth, professional, non-distracting, and engaging viewing experience, and is a passable reflection of in-person attendance to the degree this is possible. 

## Physical Controls
The controls which the lighting volunteer is responsible for and through which they will fulfill their role are the following:

- Video switcher
- Video chanel router
- Remote camera controls (two remote controlled cameras, currently)
- Two cameras on tripods

The production volunteer should be familiar with the function and usage of each of these. 

### Video switcher
- This consists of 8 buttons corresponding to different video feeds. The button lit in green is the active feed being sent to the output (this feed is visible on the to right panel of the video monitor) and the button lit in red indicates the selected feed which will be switched to the active feed if prompted (this feed is visible on the top left panel of the video monitor). 
- The 'auto' button fades between the selected and active video feeds. The 'cut' button switches abruptly between the feeds and should generally not be used.
- The lower half of the video monitor is dedicated to the 8 available video feeds. These match the 8 buttons labeled 1-4 on the top row and 5-8 on the bottom row. Only feeds 1-6 are used in the regular course of a service. 

### Video chanel patcher
### Remote camera controls (two remote controlled cameras)
### Two cameras on tripods
- Camera 4 is located at the front stage left corner of the booth. It typically provides a static wide shot of the full stage. 
- Camera 3 is located just to the right of the video switcher. This camera is generally used to focus a static shot of the worship leader or speaker. It can be pivoted, and the focus is controlled by a rocker switch the top of the camera. 

## Setup and Teardown

### Setup / Before Service
- Ensure the booth power is on __more on this__. 
- Turn on camera 3 and set to record (and is positioned correctly for the first song). If memory space will not sustain recording the services for the day, delete older video files until there is enough storage
- Turn on camera 4
- Send the welcome slide loop to the livestream feed before the livestream is started

### Teardown / After Service
- Play outro slides from the end of service until the crowd in the church begins to thin out
- Turn off camera 3 __Generally, I delete video files immediately, but this is probably poor general practice. My anal-retentive nature, I guess__
- Turn off camera 4
- The projection volunteer is generally responsible for turning off booth power

## Typical Order of Service and Responsibilities
- Send the welcome slides to the video output feed until service starts.
- Send the welcome video to the livestream feed.
- Switch video feeds as appropriate through the worship and message. Put up slides and visual aids briefly, but so that the livestream audience could follow and understand them as necessary. 
- Display the 'ways to give' slide briefly while the giving time is announced.
- Play the outtro slides after service ends until the church has mostly emptied.
